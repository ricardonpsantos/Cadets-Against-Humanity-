# Cadets Against Humanity!
A 2-day group project developed over the weekend.
Our idea was to recreate the popular card game "Cards Against Humanity" (and make it playable in the terminal), which is, a famous party icebreaker, adults-only game for players mature enough to handle the intentionally provocative (but often hilarious) topics and answers. The goal is to pair the answer and question cards in the funniest, most provocative, or the cleverest way you can.
